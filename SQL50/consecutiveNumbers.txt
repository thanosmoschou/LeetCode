Table: Logs

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| num         | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
In SQL, id is the primary key for this table.
id is an autoincrement column.
 

Find all numbers that appear at least three times consecutively.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Logs table:
+----+-----+
| id | num |
+----+-----+
| 1  | 1   |
| 2  | 1   |
| 3  | 1   |
| 4  | 2   |
| 5  | 1   |
| 6  | 2   |
| 7  | 2   |
+----+-----+
Output: 
+-----------------+
| ConsecutiveNums |
+-----------------+
| 1               |
+-----------------+
Explanation: 1 is the only number that appears consecutively for at least three times.

My Solution:

# Write your MySQL query statement below
select distinct t1.num as ConsecutiveNums
from Logs as t1, Logs as t2, Logs as t3
where t1.num = t2.num and t2.num = t3.num and t1.id + 1 = t2.id and t2.id + 1 = t3.id
