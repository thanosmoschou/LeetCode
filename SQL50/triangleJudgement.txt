Table: Triangle

+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| x           | int  |
| y           | int  |
| z           | int  |
+-------------+------+
In SQL, (x, y, z) is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table contains the lengths of three line segments.
 

Report for every three line segments whether they can form a triangle.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Triangle table:
+----+----+----+
| x  | y  | z  |
+----+----+----+
| 13 | 15 | 30 |
| 10 | 20 | 15 |
+----+----+----+
Output: 
+----+----+----+----------+
| x  | y  | z  | triangle |
+----+----+----+----------+
| 13 | 15 | 30 | No       |
| 10 | 20 | 15 | Yes      |
+----+----+----+----------+

My Solution:

Remember this: Use the Triangle Inequality Theorem, which states that the sum of two side lengths of a triangle is always greater than the third side. If this is true for all three combinations of added side lengths, then you will have a triangle.


# Write your MySQL query statement below
select x, y, z,
case
    when x + y > z and y + z > x and x + z > y then 'Yes'
    else 'No'
end as triangle
