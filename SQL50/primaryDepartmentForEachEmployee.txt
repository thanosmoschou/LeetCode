Table: Employee

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   |  Type   |
+---------------+---------+
| employee_id   | int     |
| department_id | int     |
| primary_flag  | varchar |
+---------------+---------+
(employee_id, department_id) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
employee_id is the id of the employee.
department_id is the id of the department to which the employee belongs.
primary_flag is an ENUM (category) of type ('Y', 'N'). If the flag is 'Y', the department is the primary department for the employee. If the flag is 'N', the department is not the primary.
 

Employees can belong to multiple departments. When the employee joins other departments, they need to decide which department is their primary department. Note that when an employee belongs to only one department, their primary column is 'N'.

Write a solution to report all the employees with their primary department. For employees who belong to one department, report their only department.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Employee table:
+-------------+---------------+--------------+
| employee_id | department_id | primary_flag |
+-------------+---------------+--------------+
| 1           | 1             | N            |
| 2           | 1             | Y            |
| 2           | 2             | N            |
| 3           | 3             | N            |
| 4           | 2             | N            |
| 4           | 3             | Y            |
| 4           | 4             | N            |
+-------------+---------------+--------------+
Output: 
+-------------+---------------+
| employee_id | department_id |
+-------------+---------------+
| 1           | 1             |
| 2           | 1             |
| 3           | 3             |
| 4           | 3             |

Explanation: 
- The Primary department for employee 1 is 1.
- The Primary department for employee 2 is 1.
- The Primary department for employee 3 is 3.
- The Primary department for employee 4 is 3.


My Solution:

# Write your MySQL query statement below
select employee_id, department_id
from Employee
group by employee_id
having count(department_id) = 1
union
select employee_id, department_id
from Employee
where primary_flag = 'Y'

Info:

The UNION operator is used to combine the result-set of two or more SELECT statements.

(The SELECT statement is used to select data from a database.
The data returned is stored in a result table, called the result-set.

SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name;

Here, column1, column2, ... are the field names of the table you want to select data from. If you want to select all the fields available in the table, use the following syntax:

SELECT * FROM table_name;)

Every SELECT statement within UNION must have the same number of columns
The columns must also have similar data types
The columns in every SELECT statement must also be in the same order
UNION Syntax
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table1
UNION
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table2;
UNION ALL Syntax
The UNION operator selects only distinct values by default. To allow duplicate values, use UNION ALL:

SELECT column_name(s) FROM table1
UNION ALL
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table2;
Note: The column names in the result-set are usually equal to the column names in the first SELECT statement.
